# wavlpf

A simple software synthesizer with a Low-Pass Filter (LPF) implemented in TypeScript and Rust WASM

## Demo

*Note: This document is temporary, and was quickly generated by an LLM. It will be revised in the future.*

## Features

- **Dual Signal Processors**: Choose between TypeScript or Rust WASM implementations
  - Real-time performance comparison with millisecond precision timing
  - Identical audio processing algorithms for accurate benchmarking
- **220Hz Wave Generator**: Sawtooth or Pulse waveforms with configurable duty ratio
- **Biquad LPF Filter**: Interactive filter controlled by mouse
  - X-axis: Cutoff Frequency (20Hz - configurable max)
  - Y-axis: Resonance Q-value (0.5 - configurable max, inverted: Up = High, Down = Low)
  - Configurable cutoff decay (Hz or Cent per millisecond)
- **Non-Realtime Rendering**: WebAudio-independent signal processing
- **Configurable Audio Buffer**: BPM and beat-based audio generation timing
- **WAV Generation**: Converts processed audio to WAV format
- **Tone.js Integration**: Clean audio playback
- **Settings Persistence**: Import/Export settings as JSON files

### Development Guide

- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Development Framework and Testing Strategy

## Getting Started

For details on the development framework and testing strategy, please refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

For waveform visualization integration, please refer to [CAT_OSCILLOSCOPE_LIBRARY_BEST_PRACTICES.md](CAT_OSCILLOSCOPE_LIBRARY_BEST_PRACTICES.md).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm
- Rust and wasm-pack (for building the WASM module)

To install Rust and wasm-pack:
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install wasm-pack
cargo install wasm-pack
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with Hot Module Replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch a Vite development server with instant HMR. Your browser will automatically open to http://localhost:8080.

### Build

Build the WASM module and the entire application:

```bash
# Build WASM module only
npm run build:wasm

# Build everything (WASM + TypeScript + Vite production bundle)
npm run build
```

Runs TypeScript type checking, builds the Rust WASM module, and creates the production bundle with Vite.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

Locally preview the production build before deployment.

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test         # Watch mode
npm run test:run # Run once
npm run test:ui  # Visual test runner
npm run coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### Run (Legacy)

Note: The `serve` command now uses Vite's preview server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then, open http://localhost:8080 in your browser (for development, please use `npm run dev`).

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click anywhere on the page to start the audio context
3. **Select Signal Processor**: Choose between TypeScript or Rust WASM from the dropdown
4. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Waveform Type: Sawtooth or Pulse
   - Duty Ratio: For pulse waveforms (0-100%)
   - BPM and Beat: Control audio generation timing
   - Q Max Value: Maximum resonance value
   - Cutoff Freq Max: Maximum cutoff frequency
   - Decay Unit: Hz or Cent
   - Decay Rate: Decay rate per millisecond
5. Move your mouse to control filter parameters in real-time:
   - **Horizontal position (X)**: Controls cutoff frequency (20Hz - max)
   - **Vertical position (Y)**: Controls resonance/Q value (0.5 - max, inverted: Up = High, Down = Low)
6. Observe the **Generation time** display to compare processor performance
7. Listen to new audio generated based on your BPM and beat settings

## Architecture

### Signal Processing (WebAudio Independent)

#### TypeScript Implementation
- `src/oscillator.ts`: Sawtooth and pulse wave generators
- `src/filter.ts`: Biquad LPF implementation using RBJ Audio EQ Cookbook formulas
- `src/wav.ts`: WAV file format generation

#### Rust WASM Implementation
- `wasm-audio/src/lib.rs`: Complete signal processing pipeline in Rust
  - Oscillator generation (sawtooth, pulse)
  - Biquad LPF filter with the same algorithm as TypeScript
  - Audio rendering with cutoff decay
- `wasm-audio/pkg/`: Generated WASM bindings

#### Integration
- `src/wasmAudio.ts`: TypeScript wrapper for WASM module
  - Dynamic WASM loading
  - Fallback to TypeScript on errors

### Application

- `src/synth.ts`: Main synthesizer logic including mouse tracking, processor selection, and audio playback
- `src/settings.ts`: Settings persistence (localStorage and JSON import/export)
- `src/index.ts`: Entry point
- `index.html`: Web interface

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. Deployment workflow:

1. Install Node.js dependencies
2. Build TypeScript to JavaScript
3. Copy necessary files from `index.html`, `dist/`, and `node_modules/` to the deployment directory
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
